## 📌 Project Overview

The robot was designed and built as a small-scale academic prototype to explore multi-legged locomotion and system integration under real constraints.

The main goal of this project was not to develop a commercial platform, but to understand and validate the complete development cycle of a robotic system, from design to testing.

Key objectives included:

- Designing and manufacturing custom mechanical parts using 3D printing  
- Integrating servomotors, sensors, and control electronics  
- Implementing basic gait and heading control  
- Validating behavior through simulation and physical experiments  
- Producing structured technical and user documentation

## ⚙️ Main Components

The system is built using the following main hardware elements:

- Arduino Mega 2560  
- PCA9685 Servo Controller  
- MPU6050 IMU  
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor  
- Li-ion Battery 7.4V 5000mAh  
- Buck Converter (ARCELI 20A)  
- RGB Status LED  
- Push Button / Mode Switch  

**Actuators:**

- 6× Parallax high-torque servomotors (femur joints)  
- 7× SG90 micro servomotors (coxa joints and ultrasonic scan)
